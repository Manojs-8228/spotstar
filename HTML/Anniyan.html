                    Anniyan (transl.â€‰Stranger) is a 2005 Indian Tamil-language psychological action thriller film co-written and directed by 
                    S. Shankar and produced by V. Ravichandran under Aascar Films. The film centres on a disillusioned everyman, whose frustration
                    at what he sees as increasing social apathy and public negligence leads to a split personality that attempts to improve the system. 
                    Vikram as Ambi, an idealistic, law-abiding lawyer who has multiple personality disorder and develops two other identities: a suave 
                    fashion model named Remo and a murderous vigilante named Anniyan. Sadha, Vivek, Nedumudi Venu, Nassar and Prakash Raj feature in 
                    supporting roles.
