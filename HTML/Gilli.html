                    Ghilli is a 2004 Indian Tamil-language sports action film[8] directed by Dharani and produced by Sri Suriya Movies.
                    It is a remake of the Telugu film Okkadu (2003), written and directed by Gunasekhar, with few changes made to the 
                    story. The film stars Vijay in the lead role, alongside Trisha, Prakash Raj, Ashish Vidyarthi, Dhamu, Mayilsamy, 
                    Janaki Sabesh, Nancy Jennifer, Nagendra Prasad, Ponnambalam and Pandu. The film is about a Kabaddi player, who goes 
                    to Madurai to participate in a exhibition match, but instead rescues a woman from a gang leader who is obsessed with her.
